Q1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?
If you are going to work collaboratively with other people or be working on different 
computers or offices, having a remote repository could be very helpful.

Q2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be working on something that is not ready or may have bugs and do not want
to pull the changes until it is ready. If Git is doing it automatically you have no control
or when the changes are pulled or pushed.
