Q1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?
If you are going to work collaboratively with other people or be working on different 
computers or offices, having a remote repository could be very helpful.

Q2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be working on something that is not ready or may have bugs and do not want
to pull the changes until it is ready. If Git is doing it automatically you have no control
or when the changes are pulled or pushed.

Q3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

A branch occurs in a single repository. You create a new branch when you are trying
to add a new feature or create a new version. A fork is a copy created exclusively
within Git Hub. A clone copies a repository from Git Hub to your local computer or
within your local computer in another folder.
