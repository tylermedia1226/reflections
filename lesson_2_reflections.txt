Q1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a way to track changes to files in the repository with commits. This allows
us to use git to track changes and revert to older version of a file.

Q2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary "home" for files you would like to commit. It's not a
repository because it doesn't track the commits and it's not a working directory, since
you don't run files from the staging area. It allows you to have multiple files in a 
single commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area allows you to compare the changes (across files if necessary) before
committing them. This allows you to review the changes and make sure there is one commit
per logical change.
